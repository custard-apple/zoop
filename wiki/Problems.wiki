#summary The Zoop approach to solving common problems

This section illustrates common problems a developer might runs into when developing html applications from scratch as well as Zoop based solutions for each of those problems.

Zoop was designed to solve certain problems in the most elegant and practical way possible.  I decided that the best way to teach people how to use Zoop is to list the sorts of problems that Zoop was designed to solve and then, for each problem, show how Zoop can be used to solve it.  These wiki entries should also be useful in evaluating the usefulness of Zoop for any particular project.  There is one article for each problem and it's corresponding solution.
