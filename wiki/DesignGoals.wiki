= Introduction =

The basic idea behind Zoop 1.50 is to build a better Zoop.  We want to identify areas where Zoop is weak and make it better.

= Details =

The main areas where we intend to improve on Zoop are as follows:
  # Combine the best of each different branch of Pehppy/Zoop
  # More consistent, intuitive naming of classes, methods, functions, variables, etc.
  # Cleaner implementation of certain zoop modules.
  # Improved approach to solving certain types of problems.
  # Better documentation.
    # Teaching people new to Zoop.
    # Providing a reference to experienced Zoop users.
    # Providing examples, articles and tutorials to help people understand Zoop concepts and methods.

As the idea is basically just to make Zoop better we encourage any feedback we can get from the Zoop community.
