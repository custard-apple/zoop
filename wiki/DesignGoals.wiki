= Introduction =

The basic idea behind Zoop 1.50 is to build a better Zoop.  We want to identify areas where Zoop is weak and make it better.

= Details =

The main areas where we intend to improve on Zoop are as follows:
  # Combine the best of each different branch of Pehppy/Zoop
  # More consistent, intuitive naming of classes, methods, functions, variables, etc.
  # Cleaner implementation of certain zoop modules.
  # Improved approach to solving certain types of problems.
